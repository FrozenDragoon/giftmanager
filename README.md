Comprehensive Control: Seamlessly add, edit, and delete gift ideas.

Detailed Information: Include important details for each gift idea, such as name, description, and link.

Automated Alerts: Effortlessly mark ideas as "Bought" or "Not Bought," with 

 sent to buyers when ideas are removed.

Complete Transparency: View all relevant information for your gift ideas, including who added them and who bought them.

Organized and Personalized: Keep your gift lists tidy, with each user's list displayed alphabetically and your own list always at the top.

Surprise Preservation: Keep the excitement alive—others can see if an idea is bought, but you cannot, so you won’t know what gifts you’ll receive. Additionally, you won’t see what others have added to your list, keeping surprises intact.
